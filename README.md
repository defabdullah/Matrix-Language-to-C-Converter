# C-Code-Interpreter
This project translates .mat files(which is custom language used for this project) to c files. There are 9 c files one header file in the project. These
are

1. main.c
2. parsingFunctions.c
3. printFunctions.c
4. declarationParser.c
5. statementFunctions.c
6. forParser.c
7. expressionParser.c
8. paranthesisParser.c
9. chooseParser.c
10.main.h

-Also it has makefile to compile all project you can use it with >make command.

## main.c

The entrance file of the program is main.c. It basically reads input from file and sends
formatted line to related function.
Opens the .mat file and reads the file line by line. Firstly, it adds white space before and after
all chars that are not alphanumeric or point. Then line is ready for traversing token by token.
Ex: “n=10” → “n = 10”
For declaration lines, if variable name is valid ,this extended line is sent to the related
declaration parser function. If declaration statement starts with scalar it sends to scalar_line
function. Same goes for other types.
For statement lines, If line starts with a keyword (print, printsep, for )it sends to related
function. Else it is considered as assignment statement and is sent to assignment_statement
function.

## parsingFunctions.c

This file contains helper functions for parsing strings. It has trim function for splitting. It
has is_alpha_numeric functions that returns 1 if the string is alpha_numeric, otherwise returns 0.
is_valid_variable_name funciton hat returns 1 if the string is valid variable name, otherwise returns 0. It has strrev funciton for reversing string.

It has is_scalar and is_matrix functions for checking expressions’ return type. It has
return_type_function which returns the type of the functions. It has function first_size and
second_size functions which returns sizes of matrix and vectors. For vectors second size is 1.It has
also isDeclared functions. If the string is declared variable, returns type. Else returns empty.

  This file also has exit_program function which terminates the program and prints the error
statement to console.

## printFunctions.c

In this project there are some template functions that will be printed to translated c file.
These functions is written in string format and are always printed to translated c file.
printFuncitons.c file stores these strings and prints to translated c file.

## declarationParser.c

This file contains functions related to declarations. If the line is a declaration line main
function sends line to a declarationParser function. It has three functions scalar_line,vector_line and
matrix_line. scalar_line parse scalar functions and checks if it is valid declaration, if so it prints
declaration to the translated c file. Also, adds variable name to scalar array. This array used in
statement functions to check if a variable is declared or not. Same goes for vector_line and
matrix_line.

## statementFunctions.c

This file contains functions related to statements. If the line is a statement line main function
sends line to a statementFunction function. It has four functions.
First one is assignment_statement function and it is entrance function, that is it is only
function that is called in another function. assignment_statement function is called in main.c. This
function checks if there is an “=” sign after the variable name if there is not, statement should be
variable [scalar] or variable [scalar][scalar]. For that kind of statements assignment_statement
function sends statements to assign_value_specified_index function. If there is “=” sign and after
that there is “{“ sign then assignment_statement function sends remaining part to matrix_initializer
function. If there is no such sign ssignment_statement function sends remaining part to
parseParanthesis function which is a function in paranthesisParser.c. Then assign returning value to
variable, if there is no type compatibility problem and there is no boundary problem for matrixes
and vectors.

Second one is assign_value_specified_index function. It takes a string like that matrix
[scalar][scalar] = <expression> and sends <expression> part to parseParanthesis function and
assigns return value to variable.

Third one is matrix_initializer function. It takes a statement like that <variable_name> =
{ scalar scalar ...}. It parses and sends scalars to parseParanthesis function and assigns return value
that index.

Fourth one is print_line function. It is called only in main.c, if there is print keyword at the
beginning of the statement. print_line takes statement in that form print(<expression>) and sends
expression to parseParanthesis. If return value is scalar, then it prints printScalar to translated c file.
If it is matrix or vector, then it prints printMatrix to translated c file.

## forParser.c
This file contains functions related to for parsing. If the line is a for initializing line main
function sends line to a forParser function. It has two functions, parseSingleFor and
parseDoubleFor. ParseSinglefor parses single for situations and the other one parses double for
situations.

## expressionParser.c

This file contains functions related to parsing expressions. This file contains six functions.

First one is expression_parser it is entrance function of the file and it is called in
parseParanthesis function. It takes line and sends to expression_divider function. Then it returns
operator type and divided expressions first and second. If operator type is summation it sends to
summation function, if substraction it sends to substraction function, if multiplication sends to
multipliciation function. If operator is none of them, it continous in the expression_parser function.
Then checks statement is a special function(tr,sqrt,choose), if so parses and return related function.
For example, tr ( A ) returns matrixTranspose(A). If it is not a special function, it can be expression
in the form A[][] and checks if it is in that form. If so, returns getValue(A,scalar,scalar). If it is not
in that form again, it checks it is a variable or numeric. If so, returns that value else gives error

Second one is expression_divider. It takes line as a parameter and divides it into to part if
there is “+”,”-”,”*”. It follows precedence rules and it is left recursive. It returns type of the
operant.
Ex : 4 + 7 * 9 + 7 → 4 + 7 * 9 and 7


Third, fourth, and fifth ones (summation,substraction,multiplication) are almost same they
takes divided line as parameters and makes the operation.

Last one is is_special_function. It takes token as parameter and returns type of special
funciton.

## paranthesisParser.c

This file contains functions related to parsing functions. This file contains entrance function
for expression. It has one function parseParanthesis. ParseParanthesis function detects the
paranthesis according to precedence rule and sends inner part to expression_parser funciton
recursively. Then, emplaces the returning value.
Ex: (7+(tr(3)) first it sends 3 to expression_parser, then tr(3) and moves on.

## chooseParser.c

This file contains a function for parsing choose function. It only has a function. It takes
string as a parameter and parses it.
Ex : choose(<expression>,<expression>,<expression>,<expression>) then parses and sends
expressions to parseParanthesis function. Then emplaces the returning value. Then it sends whole
expression to parseParanthesis function.

## main.h

There are declarations of functions, global variables in this file.
Ex : char * scalarArray[256]
char * matrixArray[256]
char * vectorArray[256]
extern char* matrixFirstSize(char *mat);
extern char* matrixFirstSize(char *mat);
